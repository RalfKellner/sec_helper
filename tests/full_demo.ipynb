WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR? THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIONS AND THE SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN PREPARED BY COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FINDINGS OF THE FEDERAL COURT OR THE CALIFORNIA COURT. IT SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OPINION OF THE COURT AS TO THE MERITS OF ANY OF THE CLAIMS OR DEFENSES RAISED BY ANY OF THE PARTIES OR THE FAIRNESS OR ADEQUACY OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT. FEDERAL COURT PROCEEDINGS On August 19, 2019, an Apple stockholder commenced a stockholder derivative action in Federal Court captioned as Zehrer v. Cook, et al. , Case No. 4:19-cv-05153, (the “ Zehrer Action”) against defendants Cook, Maestri, Federighi, Levinson, Gore, Jung, Bell, Sugar, Iger, and Wagner alleging, among other things, that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties (i) by causing or allowing the Company to address the effects of aging iPhone batteries by disseminating iOS software updates designed to slow iPhone performance without customer knowledge or consent in violation of consumer protection laws and regulations in domestic and international markets, and (ii) by making false and misleading statements to investors about the effects of aging iPhone batteries on iPhone sales growth and about iPhone demand in the Greater China region. On March 11, 2020, the Federal Court entered an order consolidating the Zehrer Action with three other, subsequently-filed actions that asserted similar claims (hereafter, the “Federal Action”). On June 29, 2020, the Federal Court appointed Robbins LLP and Weiss Law LLP as Co-Lead Counsel for the Federal Plaintiffs in the Federal Action. On August 18, 2020, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to stay the Federal Action pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the related federal securities class action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division, In re Apple Inc. Securities Litigation , Case No. 4:19-cv-02033-YGR (the “Federal Securities Action”), subject to Federal Plaintiffs’ rights to file a consolidated complaint and to seek to inspect the Company’s books and records pursuant to California Corporations Code section 1601, and to the parties’ obligation to meet and confer regarding Federal Plaintiffs’ participation in any mediation and any discovery conducted in connection with the Federal Securities Action. - 3 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS On January 25, 2021, following the partial denial of the motion to dismiss the related Federal Securities Action, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to continue the stay of the Federal Action until 30 days following the close of fact discovery in the Federal Securities Action, subject to the Company’s commitment to participate in a mediation of the derivative claims in the event of any mediation in the Federal Securities Action or other action arising from the same or similar facts; designation of the board of directors as constituted on August 19, 2019, as the relevant set of directors for purposes of evaluating Federal Plaintiffs’ demand futility allegations; and preservation of Federal Plaintiffs’ right to file a consolidated amended complaint. On June 7, August 17, and October 14, 2022, the Court granted the Federal Action parties’ stipulations to continue the stay, subject to substantially similar terms and conditions. On March 27, 2023, the Court granted the Federal Action parties’ stipulation to set a briefing schedule for Apple’s motion to dismiss the action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1. On May 24, 2023, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation extending Federal Plaintiffs’ time to complete their ongoing investigation of matters relevant to their allegations and to file their consolidated complaint. On October 5, 2023, the parties to the Federal Action filed a stipulation advising the Court that they had executed a memorandum of understanding to settle the Action, and commenced negotiations regarding a formal stipulation of settlement to be presented for the Court’s approval. CALIFORNIA COURT PROCEEDINGS On September 17, 2019, plaintiff Tim Himstreet filed a derivative action in California Court captioned as Himstreet v. Cook, et al. , Case No. 19CV355213 (the “ Himstreet Action”) asserting claims similar to those raised in the Federal Action. On August 17, 2020, plaintiff Steven Hill filed a derivative action in California Court captioned as Hill v. Cook, et al. , 20CV369387 (the “ Hill Action”), asserting similar claims. On November 16, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating the Himstreet Action and Hill Action (hereafter, the “California Action”). Pursuant to the parties’ stipulations, the California Court stayed the California Action on terms similar to those in the Federal Action, extending that stay in orders entered on July 1, 2022, October 6, 2022, and March 24, 2023. - 4 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION DEMAND On November 13, 2018, the Demanding Shareholders made a litigation demand on Apple’s board of directors asserting claims similar to those raised in the Federal Action (the “Demand”). On December 9, 2018, Apple’s board formed an advisory Demand Evaluation Committee (“DEC”) to review and investigate the Demand, with the advice of independent counsel, and report back to the full board concerning its conclusions and recommendations. THE PARTIES REACHED THE SETTLEMENT THROUGH MEDIATOR FACILITATED ARM’S-LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS On January 31, 2022, counsel for the Parties participated in a mediation session before Layn Phillips of Phillips ADR (the “Mediator”), a nationally recognized mediator with extensive experience mediating complex shareholder disputes similar to the Actions. Prior to this first mediation, the plaintiffs in the Federal Action and California Action submitted a mediation statement, made a settlement demand on Defendants, and requested certain documents, which Defendants agreed to provide. The Parties did not reach an agreement resolving the derivative litigation during the January 31, 2022 mediation session, but agreed to continue their settlement discussions under the aegis of the Mediator. Counsel for the Parties participated in another mediation session before the Mediator on April 6, 2023. At the mediation session, the Parties engaged in discussions regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the claims and defenses at issue. The parties also discussed a range of remedial options and were able to agree on a set of principles and target areas for corporate governance enhancements to be fleshed out through further negotiations. The mediation efforts actively continued telephonically for several months following the April mediation session, during which the Parties exchanged written proposals and counter proposals with the assistance and guidance of the Mediator. - 5 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS The Parties ultimately reached an agreement to settle and release all claims asserted in consideration for Apple’s agreement to adopt, implement, and/or maintain the corporate governance and oversight enhancements as set forth in Exhibit A hereto (the “Enhancements”). After reaching agreement on the substantive material terms of the Settlement, the Parties commenced negotiations facilitated by the Mediator regarding reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses to be paid to Plaintiffs’ Counsel, subject to Court approval, in consideration for the substantial benefits conferred upon Apple and its shareholders by the Settlement. The Stipulation, together with the exhibits hereto, which has been duly executed by the undersigned signatories on behalf of their respective clients, reflects the final and binding agreement by and among the Parties. On April 23, 2024, the Federal Court preliminarily approved the Settlement, authorized this Notice to be provided to Apple shareholders, and scheduled the Settlement Fairness Hearing to consider whether to grant final approval of the Settlement. WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT? The full terms and conditions of the Settlement are embodied in the Stipulation, which is on file with the Federal Court. The following is only a summary of the Stipulation. In consideration of the full settlement and release of the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims (defined below) against the Released Defendants’ Parties (defined below) and the dismissal with prejudice of the Actions, Defendants and Apple have agreed that Apple shall adopt and implement the corporate governance enhancements identified in Exhibit A to the Stipulation in the time and manner specified therein. The Board, on behalf of the Company, and in a determination made in the good faith exercise of the Board’s business judgment, acknowledges and agrees that the filing of, pendency of, and/or settlement demands made in the Actions caused Apple to adopt, implement, and/or maintain the Enhancements. The Board further acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Enhancements confer substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders; and (ii) Apple’s commitment to adopt, implement, and/or maintain the Enhancements will serve Apple and its shareholders’ best interests and constitutes fair, reasonable and adequate consideration for the release of the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims. - 6 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS The Enhancements provide for: 1. Enhanced Risk Oversight • The Company will amend the Risk Oversight Committee Charter to include a requirement that the Committee review and discuss material regulatory compliance issues relating to the Company’s products, including risks related to performance, manufacturing defects and safety, and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate potential product regulatory compliance risks. • The Chief Compliance Officer will become a member of the Risk Oversight Committee, attend the meetings thereof and, if necessary, report to the Audit and Finance Committee on the matters relating to her duties. • The Company will ensure that data (including in-store and third-party repair data, social media and other sources) bearing upon Performance Management 3 will be actively and regularly monitored, compiled, and made available to leaders on the business teams responsible for product lines, who will evaluate, and, as appropriate, address or escalate for further review and oversight, real-time trends and issues. To the extent potentially significant or material business, compliance, financial, reputational or other risks regarding Performance Management are suggested by the frequency of repair and/or replacement events, the leaders on the responsible business teams will consider recommendations for further investigation and evaluation, enhanced customer communication, and/or customer-oriented remedial action; • The Company shall establish a protocol for report evaluation, recommendation, and escalation, as appropriate. The protocol will incorporate the following provisions: 3 For purposes of this Settlement, “Performance Management” means dynamically managing performance peaks based in part on the chemical age of an iPhone’s battery. - 7 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS o Upon receipt of reports bearing on Performance Management and the related customer experience, leaders on the business teams responsible for affected product lines shall evaluate key drivers to determine whether potentially significant or material business, compliance, financial, reputational or other risks warrant further evaluation, escalation, and decision-making, including, but not limited to, recommendations for further investigation and evaluation, enhanced customer communication, and/or customer-oriented remedial action; o In the event that leaders on the business teams responsible for product lines determine further action may be necessary, they shall prepare a written report reflecting their evaluation and recommendations. Any further investigation or evaluation deemed necessary shall be undertaken immediately and completed within a reasonable time, and the results considered and included in a final escalation report, which shall be provided to the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Operations Officer. o The Chief Operations Officer (COO), or a person designated by the COO, shall work directly with the relevant business teams to timely develop and implement an action plan designed to address and resolve or mitigate business, compliance, financial and/or reputational risks arising from product field performance and related customer experience issues. o Where, as referenced above, material regulatory compliance issues relating to Performance Management are found by the relevant business teams to be significant or potentially material, or other escalation criteria established by the Risk Oversight Committee are met, escalation reports setting out proposed remedial responses shall be prepared by the business teams in conjunction with the Chief Compliance Officer and timely presented to the Risk Oversight Committee and, as appropriate, senior executives. o The Risk Oversight Committee shall review and evaluate the proposed remedial response in the escalation report and make any further recommendations as the Committee deems necessary and appropriate to ensure timely and effective risk management and mitigation. - 8 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS 2.

The adoption of this policy, and any recommendation made and adopted pursuant to it, do not constitute, and may not be construed as, an admission that any previous statement by any past or present employee, officer, or director of the Company was false or misleading. WHAT ARE THE PARTIES’ REASONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT? Plaintiffs brought their claims in good faith and continue to believe that their claims have merit but, based upon Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s investigation and prosecution of the Actions, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel have concluded that the terms and conditions of this Stipulation are fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Based on Plaintiffs’ oversight of the prosecution of this matter and with the advice of their counsel, Plaintiffs have agreed to settle and release the claims asserted in the Actions pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Stipulation, after considering (a) the substantial benefits conferred upon Apple and its shareholders through the corporate governance protections provided under the proposed Settlement; and (b) the desirability of guaranteeing those benefits by permitting the proposed Settlement to be consummated as provided by the terms of the Stipulation, and avoiding the uncertainties, delays, costs, and substantial risks entailed in further litigation. Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, that they committed, or aided and abetted in the commission of, any violation of law or duty or engaged in any wrongful acts whatsoever, including specifically those alleged in the Actions, and expressly maintain that they have complied with their statutory, fiduciary, and other legal duties, and that at all relevant times they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. Defendants, however, have also taken into account the burden, expense, and uncertainties inherent in further litigation, and have therefore determined that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Actions to be settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation. - 10 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS Each of the Parties recognizes and acknowledges that the Actions have been initiated, filed, and prosecuted by Plaintiffs in good faith and defended by Defendants in good faith, that the Actions are being voluntarily settled with the advice of counsel, and that the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate. In addition, Apple’s Board, including each of its independent, non-employee directors (including the members of the DEC), advised by outside counsel for the Company, has unanimously approved a resolution reflecting the Board’s determination, in the good faith exercise of its business judgment, that the Settlement confers substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders, and that the Settlement and each of its terms are fair and reasonable and serve the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED? WHAT CLAIMS WILL THE SETTLEMENT RELEASE? If the Settlement is approved, the Parties will request that the Federal Court enter a Final Judgment and Order Approving Derivative Action Settlement (the “Judgment”). Pursuant to the Judgment, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, the following releases will occur: Release of Claims by Plaintiffs, the Company, and the Company’s Shareholders: Plaintiffs, the Company, and by operation of law the Company’s shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever discharged, settled, and released, and shall forever be enjoined from commencing or prosecuting, any and all Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims and Settled Litigation Claims (including Unknown Claims) against the Released Defendants’ Parties. “Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims” means any and all manner of Claims, including Unknown Claims, that have been or could have been asserted in any forum derivatively or by Apple directly, arising from any act or omission alleged or claims asserted in the Actions; provided, however , that the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims shall not include any Claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the enforcement of the Settlement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims do not cover, settle, or release any direct claims held by a Plaintiff as a member of the certified class in the Federal Securities Litigation. “Settled Litigation Claims” means all Claims against any of the Released Parties, concerning or arising from the commencement, litigation, or settlement of the Claims asserted in the Actions; provided, however , that the Settled Litigation Claims shall not include any Claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the enforcement of the Settlement. - 11 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS “Unknown Claims” means any Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims which any Plaintiff, the Company, or any Current Apple Shareholders does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release of such claims and any Settled Defendants’ Claims which any Defendant, or the Company does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release of such claims, which, if known by him, her, or it, might have affected his, her, or its decision(s) with respect to this Settlement. With respect to any and all Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims and Settled Defendants’ Claims, the Parties stipulate and agree that, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Plaintiffs, Defendants, the Company, and Current Apple Shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Judgment shall have, expressly waived any and all provisions, rights, and benefits conferred by any law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of common law or foreign law, which is similar, comparable, or equivalent to California Civil Code §1542, which provides: A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party. Any of Plaintiffs, Defendants, Apple, or Current Apple Shareholders may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different from those which he, she, or it now knows or believes to be true with respect to the Settled Claims but, upon the Court’s entry of the Judgment, Plaintiffs, Defendants, Apple, and each of the Current Apple Shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever settled any and all Settled Claims without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such different or additional facts. Plaintiffs, Defendants, and the Company acknowledge that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and a key element of the Settlement. “Released Defendants’ Parties” means Defendants, the Company, and any entity in which the Company has a controlling interest, as well as their respective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, committees, joint ventures, trustees, trusts, employees, immediate family members, insurers and reinsurers (in their capacities as such), consultants, experts, and attorneys. Release of Claims by Defendants and the Company: Defendants and the Company shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever discharged, settled, and released, and shall forever be enjoined from commencing or prosecuting, any and all Settled Defendants’ Claims and Settled Litigation Claims (including Unknown Claims) against the Released Plaintiffs’ Parties. “Settled Defendants’ Claims” means all Claims that arise out of or are based upon the commencement, litigation, or settlement of the Actions; provided, however , that the Settled Defendants’ Claims shall not include any Claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the enforcement of the Settlement. “Released Plaintiffs’ Parties” means Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ Counsel, and any entity in which any Plaintiff has a controlling interest, as well as their respective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, committees, joint ventures, trustees, trusts, employees, immediate family members, insurers and reinsurers (in their capacities as such), consultants, experts, and attorneys. - 12 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS Within ten (10) calendar days of the Federal Court’s entry of the Judgment, the parties to the California Action will file a stipulation with the California Court dismissing the California Action with prejudice, and the Demanding Shareholders shall withdraw the Demand with prejudice. The “Effective Date” of the Settlement will be the first date upon which the following conditions of the Settlement have been met and occurred: (i) the Court has approved the Settlement as described herein, following notice to Current Apple Shareholders and a hearing, and entered the Judgment, and the Judgment has become Final; (ii) the California Action has been dismissed with prejudice; and (iii) the Demand has been withdrawn with prejudice. By Order of the Federal Court, all proceedings in the Federal Action, other than proceedings necessary to carry out or enforce the terms and conditions of the Stipulation, have been stayed until otherwise ordered by the Federal Court. Also, pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be approved, the Federal Court has (i) barred and enjoined the commencement or prosecution of any action asserting any Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims or Settled Litigation Claims against any of the Released Defendants’ Parties; and (b) barred and enjoined the commencement or prosecution of any action asserting any Settled Defendants’ Claims or Settled Litigation Claims against any of the Released Plaintiffs’ Parties. HOW WILL THE ATTORNEYS BE PAID? Plaintiffs’ Counsel have not received any payment for their services in pursuing the claims asserted in the Actions, nor have Plaintiffs’ Counsel been reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses. Plaintiffs’ Counsel invested their own resources for pursuing the claims asserted on a contingency basis; meaning they would only recover their expenses and be compensated for their time if they conferred substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders through this Action. In light of the risks undertaken in pursuing the Actions on a contingency basis and the substantial benefits created for Apple and its shareholders through the Settlement, the Parties agree that, subject to Court approval, Apple shall pay or cause to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses to Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the agreed amount of $6,000,000 (the “Fee and Expense Amount”). Plaintiffs’ Counsel will apply to the Court for service awards of $5,000 (“Service Awards”) to each of the Plaintiffs to be drawn from the Fee and Expense Amount. - 13 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS The Federal Court will determine whether to approve the Fee and Expense Amount and/or Service Awards. Apple shareholders are not personally liable for any such fees or expenses or Service Awards. WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE SETTLEMENT FAIRNESS HEARING BE HELD?

The Enhancements shall remain in effect for not less than four (4) years. Apple’s board of directors (the “Board”) shall oversee and confirm the timely adoption and effective implementation of the Enhancements. In the event the Board determines, based upon sound legal advice, that any element of the Enhancements conflicts with applicable law or regulation, the Board may, in the reasonable and good faith exercise of its business judgment, modify or eliminate provisions of the Enhancements as necessary to conform to the law or regulation. The Board will endeavor to modify or replace any provision found to conflict with law or regulation with measures designed to accomplish the same or similar objectives of the Enhancements. Should this occur, the Board shall describe and explain any such changes in the next periodic filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 1. Enhanced Risk Oversight • The Company will amend the Risk Oversight Committee Charter to include a requirement that the Committee review and discuss material regulatory compliance issues relating to the Company’s products, including risks related to performance, manufacturing defects and safety, and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate potential product regulatory compliance risks. • The Chief Compliance Officer will become a member of the Risk Oversight Committee, attend the meetings thereof and, if necessary, report to the Audit and Finance Committee on the matters relating to her duties. • The Company will ensure that data (including in-store and third-party repair data, social media and other sources) bearing upon Performance Management will be actively and regularly monitored, compiled, and made available to leaders on the business teams responsible for product lines, who will evaluate, and, as appropriate, address or escalate for further review and oversight, real-time trends and issues. o To the extent potentially significant or material business, compliance, financial, reputational or other risks regarding Performance Management are suggested by the frequency of repair and/or replacement events, the leaders on the responsible business teams will consider recommendations for further investigation and evaluation, enhanced customer communication, and/or customer-oriented remedial action; • The Company shall establish a protocol for report evaluation, recommendation, and escalation, as appropriate. The protocol will incorporate the following provisions: Exhibit A o Upon receipt of reports bearing on Performance Management and the related customer experience, leaders on the business teams responsible for affected product lines shall evaluate key drivers to determine whether potentially significant or material business, compliance, financial, reputational or other risks warrant further evaluation, escalation, and decision-making, including, but not limited to, recommendations for further investigation and evaluation, enhanced customer communication, and/or customer-oriented remedial action; o In the event that leaders on the business teams responsible for product lines determine further action may be necessary, they shall prepare a written report reflecting their evaluation and recommendations. Any further investigation or evaluation deemed necessary shall be undertaken immediately and completed within a reasonable time, and the results considered and included in a final escalation report, which shall be provided to the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Operations Officer. o The Chief Operations Officer (COO), or a person designated by the COO, shall work directly with the relevant business teams to timely develop and implement an action plan designed to address and resolve or mitigate business, compliance, financial and/or reputational risks arising from product field performance and related customer experience issues. o Where,as referenced above, material regulatory compliance issues relating to Performance Management are found by the relevant business teams to be significant or potentially material, or other escalation criteria established by the Risk Oversight Committee are met, escalation reports setting out proposed remedial responses shall be prepared by the business teams in conjunction with the Chief Compliance Officer and timely presented to the Risk Oversight Committee and, as appropriate, senior executives. o The Risk Oversight Committee shall review and evaluate the proposed remedial response in the escalation report and make any further recommendations as the Committee deems necessary and appropriate to ensure timely and effective risk management and mitigation. 2. Enhanced Oversight of iOS Update Transparency • Before release of an iOS update involving changes to Performance Management, the Chief Compliance Officer will review iPhone release notes on that topic in order to ensure accurate, timely, and transparent disclosures of such changes. • For purposes of this Settlement, “Performance Management” means dynamically managing performance peaks based in part on the chemical age of an iPhone’s battery. • The Chief Compliance Officer shall work with the appropriate business team leaders to ensure that Apple’s website appropriately identifies and describes the key components of such release notes relating to Performance Management. Exhibit A 3. Extension and Expansion of Previously Expired Customer Transparency Commitments ▪ Apple shall maintain easily accessible and prominent webpage(s) that provide clear and conspicuous information to consumers about lithium-ion batteries, unexpected shutdowns, and Performance Management, as defined above. The webpage(s) will provide guidance to consumers on steps they can take to maximize battery health and also describe the operation of Performance Management and its impact on iPhone battery and performance. ▪ In the event a future iOS update materially changes the impact of Performance Management, Apple shall notify consumers in a clear and conspicuous manner of those changes in the installation notes for the update. ▪ Apple will provide information to consumers in the iPhone user interface about battery health, and will notify consumers of the option to service the battery once the performance of the battery has become significantly degraded. ▪ Apple will provide its consumer-facing staff with all necessary education and training regarding: (i) the information in the webpage(s) described above; (ii) the iPhone user interface described above; and (iii) where to find further information on Apple webpage(s) or interface relating to Performance Management. ▪ Apple’s General Counsel, on an ad hoc basis, will report to the Audit and Finance Committee on any material compliance issues related to the above commitments 4. Enhanced Investor Disclosure Oversight • Apple will adopt and implement a written policy that requires the co-Chairs of the Disclosure Committee to review transcripts of each earnings call and make appropriate recommendations, as necessary, with respect to correction, clarification, further disclosure or explanation, or other actions. The adoption of this policy, and any recommendation made and adopted pursuant to it, do not constitute, and may not be construed as, an admission that any previous statement by any past or present employee, officer, or director of the Company was false or misleading.

B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS The Federal Court has scheduled a hearing to consider the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement and the Fee and Expense Amount and Service Awards (the “Settlement Fairness Hearing”). See pages 14-16 below for details about the Settlement Fairness Hearing, including the location, date, and time of the hearing. WHAT ARE THESE CASES ABOUT? WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR? THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIONS AND THE SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN PREPARED BY COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FINDINGS OF THE FEDERAL COURT OR THE CALIFORNIA COURT. IT SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OPINION OF THE COURT AS TO THE MERITS OF ANY OF THE CLAIMS OR DEFENSES RAISED BY ANY OF THE PARTIES OR THE FAIRNESS OR ADEQUACY OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT. FEDERAL COURT PROCEEDINGS On August 19, 2019, an Apple stockholder commenced a stockholder derivative action in Federal Court captioned as Zehrer v. Cook, et al. , Case No. 4:19-cv-05153, (the “ Zehrer Action”) against defendants Cook, Maestri, Federighi, Levinson, Gore, Jung, Bell, Sugar, Iger, and Wagner alleging, among other things, that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties (i) by causing or allowing the Company to address the effects of aging iPhone batteries by disseminating iOS software updates designed to slow iPhone performance without customer knowledge or consent in violation of consumer protection laws and regulations in domestic and international markets, and (ii) by making false and misleading statements to investors about the effects of aging iPhone batteries on iPhone sales growth and about iPhone demand in the Greater China region. On March 11, 2020, the Federal Court entered an order consolidating the Zehrer Action with three other, subsequently-filed actions that asserted similar claims (hereafter, the “Federal Action”). On June 29, 2020, the Federal Court appointed Robbins LLP and Weiss Law LLP as Co-Lead Counsel for the Federal Plaintiffs in the Federal Action. - 3 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS On August 18, 2020, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to stay the Federal Action pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the related federal securities class action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division, In re Apple Inc. Securities Litigation , Case No. 4:19-cv-02033-YGR (the “Federal Securities Action”), subject to Federal Plaintiffs’ rights to file a consolidated complaint and to seek to inspect the Company’s books and records pursuant to California Corporations Code section 1601, and to the parties’ obligation to meet and confer regarding Federal Plaintiffs’ participation in any mediation and any discovery conducted in connection with the Federal Securities Action. On January 25, 2021, following the partial denial of the motion to dismiss the related Federal Securities Action, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to continue the stay of the Federal Action until 30 days following the close of fact discovery in the Federal Securities Action, subject to the Company’s commitment to participate in a mediation of the derivative claims in the event of any mediation in the Federal Securities Action or other action arising from the same or similar facts; designation of the board of directors as constituted on August 19, 2019, as the relevant set of directors for purposes of evaluating Federal Plaintiffs’ demand futility allegations; and preservation of Federal Plaintiffs’ right to file a consolidated amended complaint. On June 7, August 17, and October 14, 2022, the Court granted the Federal Action parties’ stipulations to continue the stay, subject to substantially similar terms and conditions. On March 27, 2023, the Court granted the Federal Action parties’ stipulation to set a briefing schedule for Apple’s motion to dismiss the action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1. On May 24, 2023, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation extending Federal Plaintiffs’ time to complete their ongoing investigation of matters relevant to their allegations and to file their consolidated complaint. On October 5, 2023, the parties to the Federal Action filed a stipulation advising the Court that they had executed a memorandum of understanding to settle the Action, and commenced negotiations regarding a formal stipulation of settlement to be presented for the Court’s approval. - 4 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS CALIFORNIA COURT PROCEEDINGS On September 17, 2019, plaintiff Tim Himstreet filed a derivative action in California Court captioned as Himstreet v. Cook, et al. , Case No. 19CV355213 (the “ Himstreet Action”) asserting claims similar to those raised in the Federal Action. On August 17, 2020, plaintiff Steven Hill filed a derivative action in California Court captioned as Hill v. Cook, et al. , 20CV369387 (the “ Hill Action”), asserting similar claims. On November 16, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating the Himstreet Action and Hill Action (hereafter, the “California Action”). Pursuant to the parties’ stipulations, the California Court stayed the California Action on terms similar to those in the Federal Action, extending that stay in orders entered on July 1, 2022, October 6, 2022, and March 24, 2023. SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION DEMAND On November 13, 2018, the Demanding Shareholders made a litigation demand on Apple’s board of directors asserting claims similar to those raised in the Federal Action (the “Demand”). On December 9, 2018, Apple’s board formed an advisory Demand Evaluation Committee (“DEC”) to review and investigate the Demand, with the advice of independent counsel, and report back to the full board concerning its conclusions and recommendations. THE PARTIES REACHED THE SETTLEMENT THROUGH MEDIATOR FACILITATED ARM’S-LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS On January 31, 2022, counsel for the Parties participated in a mediation session before Layn Phillips of Phillips ADR (the “Mediator”), a nationally recognized mediator with extensive experience mediating complex shareholder disputes similar to the Actions. Prior to this first mediation, the plaintiffs in the Federal Action and California Action submitted a mediation statement, made a settlement demand on Defendants, and requested certain documents, which Defendants agreed to provide. The Parties did not reach an agreement resolving the derivative litigation during the January 31, 2022 mediation session, but agreed to continue their settlement discussions under the aegis of the Mediator. Counsel for the Parties participated in another mediation session before the Mediator on April 6, 2023. At the mediation session, the Parties engaged in discussions regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the claims and defenses at issue. The parties also discussed a range of remedial options and were able to agree on a set of principles and target areas for corporate governance enhancements to be fleshed out through further negotiations. The mediation efforts actively continued telephonically for several months following the April mediation session, during which the Parties exchanged written proposals and counter proposals with the assistance and guidance of the Mediator. - 5 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS The Parties ultimately reached an agreement to settle and release all claims asserted in consideration for Apple’s agreement to adopt, implement, and/or maintain the corporate governance and oversight enhancements as set forth in Exhibit A hereto (the “Enhancements”). After reaching agreement on the substantive material terms of the Settlement, the Parties commenced negotiations facilitated by the Mediator regarding reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses to be paid to Plaintiffs’ Counsel, subject to Court approval, in consideration for the substantial benefits conferred upon Apple and its shareholders by the Settlement. The Stipulation, together with the exhibits hereto, which has been duly executed by the undersigned signatories on behalf of their respective clients, reflects the final and binding agreement by and among the Parties. On April 23, 2024, the Federal Court preliminarily approved the Settlement, authorized this Notice to be provided to Apple shareholders, and scheduled the Settlement Fairness Hearing to consider whether to grant final approval of the Settlement. WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT? The full terms and conditions of the Settlement are embodied in the Stipulation, which is on file with the Federal Court. The following is only a summary of the Stipulation. In consideration of the full settlement and release of the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims (defined below) against the Released Defendants’ Parties (defined below) and the dismissal with prejudice of the Actions, Defendants and Apple have agreed that Apple shall adopt and implement the corporate governance enhancements identified in Exhibit A to the Stipulation in the time and manner specified therein. The Board, on behalf of the Company, and in a determination made in the good faith exercise of the Board’s business judgment, acknowledges and agrees that the filing of, pendency of, and/or settlement demands made in the Actions caused Apple to adopt, implement, and/or maintain the Enhancements. The Board further acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Enhancements confer substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders; and (ii) Apple’s commitment to adopt, implement, and/or maintain the Enhancements will serve Apple and its shareholders’ best interests and constitutes fair, reasonable and adequate consideration for the release of the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims. - 6 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS The Enhancements provide for: 1. Enhanced Risk Oversight • The Company will amend the Risk Oversight Committee Charter to include a requirement that the Committee review and discuss material regulatory compliance issues relating to the Company’s products, including risks related to performance, manufacturing defects and safety, and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate potential product regulatory compliance risks. • The Chief Compliance Officer will become a member of the Risk Oversight Committee, attend the meetings thereof and, if necessary, report to the Audit and Finance Committee on the matters relating to her duties. • The Company will ensure that data (including in-store and third-party repair data, social media and other sources) bearing upon Performance Management 3 will be actively and regularly monitored, compiled, and made available to leaders on the business teams responsible for product lines, who will evaluate, and, as appropriate, address or escalate for further review and oversight, real-time trends and issues. To the extent potentially significant or material business, compliance, financial, reputational or other risks regarding Performance Management are suggested by the frequency of repair and/or replacement events, the leaders on the responsible business teams will consider recommendations for further investigation and evaluation, enhanced customer communication, and/or customer-oriented remedial action; 3 For purposes of this Settlement, “Performance Management” means dynamically managing performance peaks based in part on the chemical age of an iPhone’s battery. - 7 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS • The Company shall establish a protocol for report evaluation, recommendation, and escalation, as appropriate. The protocol will incorporate the following provisions: o Upon receipt of reports bearing on Performance Management and the related customer experience, leaders on the business teams responsible for affected product lines shall evaluate key drivers to determine whether potentially significant or material business, compliance, financial, reputational or other risks warrant further evaluation, escalation, and decision-making, including, but not limited to, recommendations for further investigation and evaluation, enhanced customer communication, and/or customer-oriented remedial action; o In the event that leaders on the business teams responsible for product lines determine further action may be necessary, they shall prepare a written report reflecting their evaluation and recommendations. Any further investigation or evaluation deemed necessary shall be undertaken immediately and completed within a reasonable time, and the results considered and included in a final escalation report, which shall be provided to the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Operations Officer. o The Chief Operations Officer (COO), or a person designated by the COO, shall work directly with the relevant business teams to timely develop and implement an action plan designed to address and resolve or mitigate business, compliance, financial and/or reputational risks arising from product field performance and related customer experience issues. o Where, as referenced above, material regulatory compliance issues relating to Performance Management are found by the relevant business teams to be significant or potentially material, or other escalation criteria established by the Risk Oversight Committee are met, escalation reports setting out proposed remedial responses shall be prepared by the business teams in conjunction with the Chief Compliance Officer and timely presented to the Risk Oversight Committee and, as appropriate, senior executives. - 8 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS o The Risk Oversight Committee shall review and evaluate the proposed remedial response in the escalation report and make any further recommendations as the Committee deems necessary and appropriate to ensure timely and effective risk management and mitigation. 2. Enhanced Oversight of iOS Update Transparency • Before release of an iOS update involving changes to Performance Management, the Chief Compliance Officer will review iPhone release notes on that topic in order to ensure accurate, timely, and transparent disclosures of such changes. • The Chief Compliance Officer shall work with the appropriate business team leaders to ensure that Apple’s website appropriately identifies and describes the key components of such release notes relating to Performance Management. 3. Extension and Expansion of Previously Expired Customer Transparency Commitments • Apple shall maintain easily accessible and prominent webpage(s) that provide clear and conspicuous information to consumers about lithium-ion batteries, unexpected shutdowns, and Performance Management, as defined above. The webpage(s) will provide guidance to consumers on steps they can take to maximize battery health and also describe the operation of Performance Management and its impact on iPhone battery and performance. • In the event a future iOS update materially changes the impact of Performance Management, Apple shall notify consumers in a clear and conspicuous manner of those changes in the installation notes for the update. • Apple will provide information to consumers in the iPhone user interface about battery health, and will notify consumers of the option to service the battery once the performance of the battery has become significantly degraded. • Apple will provide its consumer-facing staff with all necessary education and training regarding: (i) the information in the webpage(s) described above; (ii) the iPhone user interface described above; and (iii) where to find further information on Apple webpage(s) or interface relating to Performance Management. - 9 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS • Apple’s General Counsel, on an ad hoc basis, will report to the Audit and Finance Committee on any material compliance issues related to the above commitments 4. Enhanced Investor Disclosure Oversight • Apple will adopt and implement a written policy that requires the co-Chairs of the Disclosure Committee to review transcripts of each earnings call and make appropriate recommendations, as necessary, with respect to correction, clarification, further disclosure or explanation, or other actions. The adoption of this policy, and any recommendation made and adopted pursuant to it, do not constitute, and may not be construed as, an admission that any previous statement by any past or present employee, officer, or director of the Company was false or misleading. WHAT ARE THE PARTIES’ REASONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT? Plaintiffs brought their claims in good faith and continue to believe that their claims have merit but, based upon Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s investigation and prosecution of the Actions, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel have concluded that the terms and conditions of this Stipulation are fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Based on Plaintiffs’ oversight of the prosecution of this matter and with the advice of their counsel, Plaintiffs have agreed to settle and release the claims asserted in the Actions pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Stipulation, after considering (a) the substantial benefits conferred upon Apple and its shareholders through the corporate governance protections provided under the proposed Settlement; and (b) the desirability of guaranteeing those benefits by permitting the proposed Settlement to be consummated as provided by the terms of the Stipulation, and avoiding the uncertainties, delays, costs, and substantial risks entailed in further litigation. Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, that they committed, or aided and abetted in the commission of, any violation of law or duty or engaged in any wrongful acts whatsoever, including specifically those alleged in the Actions, and expressly maintain that they have complied with their statutory, fiduciary, and other legal duties, and that at all relevant times they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. Defendants, however, have also taken into account the burden, expense, and uncertainties inherent in further litigation, and have therefore determined that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Actions to be settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation. - 10 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS Each of the Parties recognizes and acknowledges that the Actions have been initiated, filed, and prosecuted by Plaintiffs in good faith and defended by Defendants in good faith, that the Actions are being voluntarily settled with the advice of counsel, and that the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate. In addition, Apple’s Board, including each of its independent, non-employee directors (including the members of the DEC), advised by outside counsel for the Company, has unanimously approved a resolution reflecting the Board’s determination, in the good faith exercise of its business judgment, that the Settlement confers substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders, and that the Settlement and each of its terms are fair and reasonable and serve the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED? WHAT CLAIMS WILL THE SETTLEMENT RELEASE? If the Settlement is approved, the Parties will request that the Federal Court enter a Final Judgment and Order Approving Derivative Action Settlement (the “Judgment”). Pursuant to the Judgment, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, the following releases will occur: Release of Claims by Plaintiffs, the Company, and the Company’s Shareholders: Plaintiffs, the Company, and by operation of law the Company’s shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever discharged, settled, and released, and shall forever be enjoined from commencing or prosecuting, any and all Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims and Settled Litigation Claims (including Unknown Claims) against the Released Defendants’ Parties. “Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims” means any and all manner of Claims, including Unknown Claims, that have been or could have been asserted in any forum derivatively or by Apple directly, arising from any act or omission alleged or claims asserted in the Actions; provided, however , that the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims shall not include any Claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the enforcement of the Settlement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims do not cover, settle, or release any direct claims held by a Plaintiff as a member of the certified class in the Federal Securities Litigation. - 11 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS “Settled Litigation Claims” means all Claims against any of the Released Parties, concerning or arising from the commencement, litigation, or settlement of the Claims asserted in the Actions; provided, however , that the Settled Litigation Claims shall not include any Claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the enforcement of the Settlement. “Unknown Claims” means any Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims which any Plaintiff, the Company, or any Current Apple Shareholders does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release of such claims and any Settled Defendants’ Claims which any Defendant, or the Company does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release of such claims, which, if known by him, her, or it, might have affected his, her, or its decision(s) with respect to this Settlement. With respect to any and all Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims and Settled Defendants’ Claims, the Parties stipulate and agree that, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Plaintiffs, Defendants, the Company, and Current Apple Shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Judgment shall have, expressly waived any and all provisions, rights, and benefits conferred by any law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of common law or foreign law, which is similar, comparable, or equivalent to California Civil Code §1542, which provides: A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party. Any of Plaintiffs, Defendants, Apple, or Current Apple Shareholders may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different from those which he, she, or it now knows or believes to be true with respect to the Settled Claims but, upon the Court’s entry of the Judgment, Plaintiffs, Defendants, Apple, and each of the Current Apple Shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever settled any and all Settled Claims without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such different or additional facts. Plaintiffs, Defendants, and the Company acknowledge that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and a key element of the Settlement. “Released Defendants’ Parties” means Defendants, the Company, and any entity in which the Company has a controlling interest, as well as their respective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, committees, joint ventures, trustees, trusts, employees, immediate family members, insurers and reinsurers (in their capacities as such), consultants, experts, and attorneys. Release of Claims by Defendants and the Company: Defendants and the Company shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever discharged, settled, and released, and shall forever be enjoined from commencing or prosecuting, any and all Settled Defendants’ Claims and Settled Litigation Claims (including Unknown Claims) against the Released Plaintiffs’ Parties. “Settled Defendants’ Claims” means all Claims that arise out of or are based upon the commencement, litigation, or settlement of the Actions; provided, however , that the Settled Defendants’ Claims shall not include any Claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the enforcement of the Settlement. - 12 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS “Released Plaintiffs’ Parties” means Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ Counsel, and any entity in which any Plaintiff has a controlling interest, as well as their respective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, committees, joint ventures, trustees, trusts, employees, immediate family members, insurers and reinsurers (in their capacities as such), consultants, experts, and attorneys. Within ten (10) calendar days of the Federal Court’s entry of the Judgment, the parties to the California Action will file a stipulation with the California Court dismissing the California Action with prejudice, and the Demanding Shareholders shall withdraw the Demand with prejudice. The “Effective Date” of the Settlement will be the first date upon which the following conditions of the Settlement have been met and occurred: (i) the Court has approved the Settlement as described herein, following notice to Current Apple Shareholders and a hearing, and entered the Judgment, and the Judgment has become Final; (ii) the California Action has been dismissed with prejudice; and (iii) the Demand has been withdrawn with prejudice. By Order of the Federal Court, all proceedings in the Federal Action, other than proceedings necessary to carry out or enforce the terms and conditions of the Stipulation, have been stayed until otherwise ordered by the Federal Court. Also, pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be approved, the Federal Court has (i) barred and enjoined the commencement or prosecution of any action asserting any Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims or Settled Litigation Claims against any of the Released Defendants’ Parties; and (b) barred and enjoined the commencement or prosecution of any action asserting any Settled Defendants’ Claims or Settled Litigation Claims against any of the Released Plaintiffs’ Parties. HOW WILL THE ATTORNEYS BE PAID? Plaintiffs’ Counsel have not received any payment for their services in pursuing the claims asserted in the Actions, nor have Plaintiffs’ Counsel been reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses. Plaintiffs’ Counsel invested their own resources for pursuing the claims asserted on a contingency basis; meaning they would only recover their expenses and be compensated for their time if they conferred substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders through this Action. In light of the risks undertaken in pursuing the Actions on a contingency basis and the substantial benefits created for Apple and its shareholders through the Settlement, the Parties agree that, subject to Court approval, Apple shall pay or cause to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses to Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the agreed amount of $6,000,000 (the “Fee and Expense Amount”). - 13 - EX. B-1 - NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS Plaintiffs’ Counsel will apply to the Court for service awards of $5,000 (“Service Awards”) to each of the Plaintiffs to be drawn from the Fee and Expense Amount. The Federal Court will determine whether to approve the Fee and Expense Amount and/or Service Awards. Apple shareholders are not personally liable for any such fees or expenses or Service Awards.

Segments The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Human Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and Policies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development. Inclusion and Diversity The Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.

Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. General Risks The price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 1C. Cybersecurity Not applicable. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16 Item 2. Properties The Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 30, 2023, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire. Masimo Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. Fiscal Period The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Fiscal Year Highlights The Company’s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. The Company’s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: First Quarter 2023: • iPad and iPad Pro; • Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and • MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. Second Quarter 2023: • MacBook Pro 14”, MacBook Pro 16” and Mac mini; and • Second-generation HomePod. Third Quarter 2023: • MacBook Air 15”, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; • Apple Vision Pro™, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and • iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company’s operating systems. Fourth Quarter 2023: • iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and • Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. In May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 Products and Services Performance The following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) 29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) 28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) 39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) 85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. Mac Mac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. iPad iPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. Products gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. Services gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt As of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios. The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions): Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022 Investment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 3,089 $ 4,022 Term debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 32 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents. Marketable Securities The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis. Derivative Instruments The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act. Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33 Note 2 – Revenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34 Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 iPhone (1) $ 200,583 $ 205,489 $ 191,973 Mac (1) 29,357 40,177 35,190 iPad (1) 28,300 29,292 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) 39,845 41,241 38,367 Services (2) 85,200 78,129 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. Total net sales include $ 8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, $ 7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $ 6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales. As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.1 billion and $ 12.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company expects 67 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25 % within one-to-two years, 7 % within two-to-three years and 1 % in greater than three years. Note 3 – Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2023 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 96,995 $ 99,803 $ 94,680 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 15,744,231 16,215,963 16,701,272 Effect of dilutive share-based awards 68,316 109,856 163,647 Weighted-average diluted shares 15,812,547 16,325,819 16,864,919 Basic earnings per share $ 6.16 $ 6.15 $ 5.67 Diluted earnings per share $ 6.13 $ 6.11 $ 5.61 Approximately 24 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

(2) As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $ 13.8 billion and $ 12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 36 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 30, 2023 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 74,427 Due after 5 years through 10 years 9,964 Due after 10 years 16,153 Total fair value $ 100,544 The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years. The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 74,730 $ 102,670 Interest rate contracts $ 19,375 $ 20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 104,777 $ 185,381 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 14,433 $ 13,378 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 18,247 ) $ ( 18,739 ) Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 %. The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41 % and 44 % of total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48 % and 23 %.

A valuation allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences. Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8 billion, of which $ 8.0 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Beginning balances $ 16,758 $ 15,477 $ 16,475 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 2,044 2,284 816 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year ( 1,463 ) ( 1,982 ) ( 1,402 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 2,628 1,936 1,607 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 19 ) ( 28 ) ( 1,838 ) Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 494 ) ( 929 ) ( 181 ) Ending balances $ 19,454 $ 16,758 $ 15,477 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Altho ugh the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 4.5 billion. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41 European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 8 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $ 2.0 billion, $ 1.9 billion and $ 1.7 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 13.9 billion, $ 14.9 billion and $ 12.9 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company made $ 1.9 billion, $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.4 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 2.1 billion, $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.3 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions): Lease-Related Assets and Liabilities Financial Statement Line Items 2023 2022 Right-of-use assets: Operating leases Other non-current assets $ 10,661 $ 10,417 Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 1,015 952 Total right-of-use assets $ 11,676 $ 11,369 Lease liabilities: Operating leases Other current liabilities $ 1,410 $ 1,534 Other non-current liabilities 10,408 9,936 Finance leases Other current liabilities 165 129 Other non-current liabilities 859 812 Total lease liabilities $ 12,842 $ 12,411 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 42 Lease liability maturities as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions): Operating Leases Finance Leases Total 2024 $ 1,719 $ 196 $ 1,915 2025 1,875 151 2,026 2026 1,732 120 1,852 2027 1,351 52 1,403 2028 1,181 34 1,215 Thereafter 5,983 872 6,855 Total undiscounted liabilities 13,841 1,425 15,266 Less: Imputed interest ( 2,023 ) ( 401 ) ( 2,424 ) Total lease liabilities $ 11,818 $ 1,024 $ 12,842 The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was 10.6 years and 10.1 years, respectively. The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was 3.0 % and 2.3 %, respectively. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $ 544 million of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026, with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 21 years.

Additionally, to manage foreign exchange rate risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company uses cross-currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 3.7 billion, $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.6 billion of interest expense on its term debt for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 44 Shares of Common Stock The following table shows the changes in shares of common stock for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 2023 2022 2021 Common stock outstanding, beginning balances 15,943,425 16,426,786 16,976,763 Common stock repurchased ( 471,419 ) ( 568,589 ) ( 656,340 ) Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 78,055 85,228 106,363 Common stock outstanding, ending balances 15,550,061 15,943,425 16,426,786 Note 11 – Share-Based Compensation 2022 Employee Stock Plan The Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022. 2014 Employee Stock Plan The Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers.

The total shares withheld were approximately 37 million, 41 million and 53 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $ 5.6 billion, $ 6.4 billion and $ 6.8 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Note 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions): 2024 $ 4,258 2025 2,674 2026 3,434 2027 1,277 2028 5,878 Thereafter 3,215 Total $ 20,736 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46 Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information. The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Americas: Net sales $ 162,560 $ 169,658 $ 153,306 Operating income $ 60,508 $ 62,683 $ 53,382 Europe: Net sales $ 94,294 $ 95,118 $ 89,307 Operating income $ 36,098 $ 35,233 $ 32,505 Greater China: Net sales $ 72,559 $ 74,200 $ 68,366 Operating income $ 30,328 $ 31,153 $ 28,504 Japan: Net sales $ 24,257 $ 25,977 $ 28,482 Operating income $ 11,888 $ 12,257 $ 12,798 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 29,615 $ 29,375 $ 26,356 Operating income $ 12,066 $ 11,569 $ 9,817 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Segment operating income $ 150,888 $ 152,895 $ 137,006 Research and development expense ( 29,915 ) ( 26,251 ) ( 21,914 ) Other corporate expenses, net (1) ( 6,672 ) ( 7,207 ) ( 6,143 ) Total operating income $ 114,301 $ 119,437 $ 108,949 (1) Includes corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009. San Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
